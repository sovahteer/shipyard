### Shipyard

Orek Drive Yards Inc. collects damaged or derelict starships and repairs them before putting them up for sale to a new owner. The shipyard has a list of potential new owners for their ships. Ships may take a while to repair before being made suitable for resale.

They are looking for an asset management system to keep track of their ships and their captains.

#### MVP:

* A list of all their ships and their admission date
* Mark a ship as being for sale/in need of repairs
* Assign a ship to a new owner
* List all the owners and their ships

#### Possible Extensions:

* CRUD actions for ships/owners
* Have separate pages for ships ready for sale and ones still in need of repairs
* Search for ships by model/type
* Any other ideas you might come up with
